        <p>We do not sell your personal information. Sharing occurs only with your separate consent and under the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Entrusted Parties</strong>: Third-party service providers (e.g., hosting, analytics) process data on our behalf under strict agreements, limited to agreed purposes, and are prohibited from subcontracting without our consent.</li>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, deletion, or alteration, as required by CSL and PIPL.
